# OSTManager

OSTManager enables you to work with multiple *AVAudioPlayers* at the same time, anywhere in your code, and it's meant to be simple. It works like this: you need to initialize a Singleton with the names of your tracks and *voilla*! You can play with them anywhere you want in the code, referencing them only by their file name! 

It's perfect for managing background music and ambience sounds in games, or when you need to play many sounds at the same time (dealing with channels) muting/unmuting them whenever you want, and similar scenarios. 

There's still a lot to be done. I'm doing my best to improve it! So, if you want to help me, feel free to contribute.
